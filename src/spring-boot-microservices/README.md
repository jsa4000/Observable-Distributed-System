In order to build the container images use tthe following commands

```bash
# Build and create Far Jar files for the microservices
mvn clean install 

# Build the images using maven spring boot plugin
mvn spring-boot:build-image
```

```bash
# Scan using the name of the image created priously
docker scan --severity high jsa4000/car-microservice:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
