# Improvements

Backlog for improvements and future evolutions. These improvements are not in the scope of the project, because of that they have been separated from the main backlog.

## Backlog

- Add **event-sourcing** or **CQRS** so micro-services are more decoupled from each other.
- Integrate a **service-mesh** system (*istio*, *linkerd*, etc..) to add more capabilities and resilience for the overall system in terms of communication, service discovery, observability, circuit breaker, security policies, load balancing, routing, health-checks, etc...
- Add **Kubernetes** support and package management for CI/CD pipelines.
